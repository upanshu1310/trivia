# TRIVIA
## Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/1eaPjWVXR7M
## Description: A very simple trivia game made using HTML CSS and JavaScript. 

The webpage is fairly simple to make and has similar design to the pset of earlier weeks.
There are 10 questions from various topics such as General Knowledge, Sports, Food, Science, etc.
Each question is wrapped in it's own div. There are 4 options to every question, each represented by a radio button. You can only select one answer for each question

At the end of the 10 questions there are 2 functional buttons:

### Submit: When user clicks on this button, all the selected options are recorded and checked. After checking, the final score (out of 10) is displayed below

### Clear: This button is used to restart the game. It clears all the selected options and also removes the previous score.
